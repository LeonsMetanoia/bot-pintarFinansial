Qualified human resources are one of the factors that influence economic development. In the context of economic development, the quality of human resources needs to be continuously improved, including strengthening their competenciesâ€”one of which is related to financial literacy. Public knowledge of financial literacy has become a necessity in daily life, making it a life skill that every individual needs to possess in order to navigate life in the long term.

A well-literate society is more capable of understanding matters related to the financial services industry and has access to information about the financial services required in their daily activities. This enables them to more easily determine the financial products and services that suit their needs and capabilities in an effort to improve their welfare. In addition, well-literate individuals tend to have better financial management skills, which supports their financial well-being. Thus, a well-literate and financially inclusive society will be formed, ultimately supporting economic development.
